//Character type?

Parameters?

//What is a statement?
//Statements are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value. Expressions evaluate to a resulting value. Letâ€™s look at some examples.Statements do not return values.

//Return values?
fn five() -> i32 {
    5
}

//Comments?
//hello world

//If statements?
   let number = 3;
    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }

//Elseif?
let number = 6;
    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");

        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }

//If in a let statement?
let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

//Loop?
//The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop
  loop {
        println!("again!");
    }

//Break out of loop?
//Break

//While loop?
   while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);
        number -= 1;
    }

//For loop?
   for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }

}
